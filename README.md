# Random-Quote-Machine
It uses api of website:"https://andruxnet-random-famous-quotes.p.mashape.com/?cat=famous", to generate random famous quotes.

Since it is using another website's data, no database is required. It displays the quote from the website for a particular period of time, and when refreshed that quote is removed from the cache memory and another quote is loaded.
JavaScript is used for responsive front end. And basic html is used for webpage.
